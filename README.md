Core Concept Analysis: COVID-19 Data Exploration

 **Project Description:**

This project analyzes a dataset containing COVID-19 cases (confirmed, deaths, recovered) from various world regions. It aims to explore trends and patterns in the data to gain insights into the pandemic's global impact.

1. **Data:**

# The project expects a CSV file named `covid_19_data.csv` containing the following columns:

- Region (country or geographical area)
- Confirmed (number of confirmed COVID-19 cases)
- Deaths (number of deaths attributed to COVID-19)
- Recovered (number of people who recovered from COVID-19)
- State (optional, might be empty)

2. **Usage:**

**To run the analysis:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies (`pip install pandas numpy`).
3. Replace `'covid_19_data.csv'` in the Jupyter Notebook code with the actual path to your data file.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `covid19_analysis.ipynb`) and run the code cells.

5. **Analysis Overview:**

The Jupyter Notebook explores the data through various techniques:

- Loading the CSV data using pandas.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and check for missing values.
- Answering specific questions about confirmed cases, deaths, recovered cases, and regional trends.
